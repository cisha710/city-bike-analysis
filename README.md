## Conclusion
In conclusion, this Tableau analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the trends and patterns in Citibike usage over a specified time period. Through the creation of interactive dashboards and visualizations, key insights have been extracted and presented, highlighting trends in user type, gender, and age, as well as trip patterns based on hours and weekdays. One noteworthy phenomenon observed from the overall analysis is the high usage of the Citibike service by residents of Jersey City, New Jersey, primarily for commuting purposes. This analysis serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the usage of Citibike and exploring the data behind this popular bike-sharing service. I hope that this work will inspire further research and investigation into the data, and encourage others to build upon the insights presented here.
